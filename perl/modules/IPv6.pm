=head1 NAME

Regexp::IPv6 - Regular expression for IPv6 addresses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Regexp::IPv6 qw($IPv6_re);

  $address =~ /^$IPv6_re$/ and print "IPv6 address\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports the $IPv6_re regular expression that matches any
valid IPv6 address as described in "RFC 2373 - 2.2 Text Representation
of Addresses" but C<::>. Any string not compliant with such RFC will
be rejected.

To match full strings use C</^$IPv6_re$/>.
