Exercises:  Do these in order.  Do all of them.  I promise not to
	    waste your time.

1. Read the code in both files, Hello.pm and hello.pl.  Run hello.pl
   and see what it does.

2. Comment out the @EXPORT line in Hello.pm and see what happens when
   you run hello.pl.

3. In Hello.pm, change

	@EXPORT = ('hello');

   to say

	@EXPORT_OK = ('hello');

   and see what happens.

4. In hello.pl, change 

	use Hello;

   to say


	use Hello ('hello');

   and see what happens.

5. Make a table that looks like this:

  `hello' mentioned in:	     |  `hello' mentioned in `use' line?  |  Did it work?
  EXPORT  EXPORT_OK  NEITHER |  **yes**         **no**            |
  ---------------------------+------------------------------------+--------------


  Do more experiements and fill out the chart.  The chart should have
  at least six entries.
   
6. Change the name of the `hello' function to be `greet'.  You will
   need to modify both files.  Take note of all the things you need to
   change.

7. Now you know how to write a module that will export functions into
   your program.  Send me some feedback.

8. If you want to write modules that implement object-oriented
   classes, go to the `Class' directory that is a sibling to this one.
