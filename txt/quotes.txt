A young man and his girlfriend were walking along Main Street when she spotted
a beautiful diamond ring in a jewelry-store window.  "Wow, I'd sure love to
have that!" she gushed.
        "No problem," her companion replied, throwing a brick through the
window and grabbing the ring.
        A few blocks later, the woman admired a full-length sable coat.  "What
I'd give to own that," she said, sighing.
        "No problem," he said, throwing a brick through the window and grabbing
the coat.
        Finally, turning for home, they passed a car dealership.  "Boy, I'd do
anything for one of those Rolls-Royces," she said.
        "Jeez, baby," the guy moaned, "you think I'm made of bricks?"
